# 👋 Hi, I'm **Guru Dayal**
### **SOC Analyst | Security Monitoring & Incident Response | Threat Hunter**

I build **hands-on cybersecurity labs** focused on *detection engineering, simulating real attacks, automation, and threat hunting* across Windows & Linux environments.  
My portfolio demonstrates real SOC workflows: detection, enrichment, automation, and ATT&CK-mapped threat hunting.

---

## 🧑‍💻 **About Me**
I’m a cybersecurity practitioner with a strong interest in **blue-team security**, specializing in **SIEM operations, threat hunting, incident triage, detection engineering, and automation**.  

My background in **Electronics Manufacturing** and **Healthcare RCM** has shaped me into someone who is:
- Extremely **detail-oriented**
- Strong in **analytical thinking**
- Comfortable handling **sensitive information (HIPAA)**
- Skilled at **investigation, troubleshooting, and structured problem-solving**
- Capable of adapting across *multiple industries* — which makes my approach to cybersecurity unique.

I’m actively seeking roles such as:
- **SOC Analyst L1**
- **Security Analyst**
- **Cybersecurity Operations / Blue Team roles**

I have built **3 full SOC-ready projects** to demonstrate job-ready capability.

## 🤖 **How I Use AI in Cybersecurity**
I use **ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini CLI, Claude Code** to:

- Generate accurate queries (Sysmon, Wazuh, Splunk)  
- Build clean detection logic & triage workflows  
- Troubleshoot configuration errors  
- Draft custom rules & simplify complex correlations  
- Speed up script creation, documentation, and analysis  
- Reduce burnout by automating repetitive triage tasks  

With strong prompt-engineering skills, I can convert abstract detection problems into **accurate, actionable outputs**, enabling fast investigation and SOC-grade efficiency.
