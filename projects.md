# 📂 Featured Cybersecurity Projects
Welcome to my projects page — a collection of hands-on SOC, detection engineering, threat hunting, and automation projects.  
Each project demonstrates real-world attack simulation, telemetry analysis, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and SOC-ready documentation.

## 🔹 SOC Home Lab — Wazuh + Sysmon + Suricata  
**Tagline:** End-to-end SOC lab simulating real adversary behavior across Windows & Linux.  
This project demonstrates:  
- LSASS credential dumping detection  
- PowerShell abuse & LOLBAS behavior  
- SSH brute-force detection  
- Nmap scan & network telemetry analysis  
- Custom Wazuh rules for endpoint + network events  
- Full ATT&CK mapping & investigation workflow
